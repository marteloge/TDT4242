\chapter{Introduction}

	In this document we will describe a test plan for testing the system SoCam. SoCam is a system for maintain the software in control units used in modern vehicles. The test plan contains a description of all the tests that should be performed, the priority and the consequences of the tests. The plan is based on a risk assessment and possible consequences connected to the risks given in the risk assessment.\\

Further on have the group members discussed the strengths and weaknesses of the system based on the given tests described in the document. This we write about in the very end of the document where we give suggestions on system improvements ordered by priority which is strongly recommended to improve before a release of the software.
